<p><strong>7pm GMT</strong> They finally get their shit together and put their site back up.</p>

<h3>29 December 2013</h3>

<p><strong>All day</strong> Their site is down (connection reset). Remember, I have stopped attacking them.</p>

<h3>28 December 2013</h3>

<p><strong>All day</strong> Their site is down (connection reset). Remember, I have stopped attacking them.</p>

<h3>27 December 2013</h3>

<p><strong>early am GMT</strong> They put up some sort of anti-DDOS protection that fails miserably.</p>

<p><strong>12:31 pm GMT</strong> They post <a href="http://www.xryshaygh.com/index.php/enimerosi/view/nea-organwmenh-epithesh-sthn-istoselida-ths-chrushs-aughs-apo-upersugchrono">this insane update</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131230073828/http://www.xryshaygh.com/index.php/enimerosi/view/nea-organwmenh-epithesh-sthn-istoselida-ths-chrushs-aughs-apo-upersugchrono">cached</a>) (<a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xryshaygh.com%2Findex.php%2Fenimerosi%2Fview%2Fnea-organwmenh-epithesh-sthn-istoselida-ths-chrushs-aughs-apo-upersugchrono">translated</a>). My favourite parts:</p>
<ul><li><strong>"All data indicates that this isn't done by simple hackers but probably partners of a foreign intelligence agency"</strong> Oh my God. These guys think I'm affiliated with the NSA or something.</li>
<li><strong>"Our 3 firewall filters were directly targetted"</strong> Really?</li>
<li><strong>"These technical abilities do not indicate the hackers that have been hitting our website so far, but expert hackers with advanced technicians, possibly associates of foreign intelligence agencies"</strong> You can't make this shit up. This is the update they posted <em>to their own people</em>. I can't believe that they believe this crap, no fucking way. These guys have absolutely no moral reservation to lie to their own.</li>
<li><strong>"Golden Dawn's rapid rise has terrorized the anti-hellenic establishment..."</strong> No, shitbags, your rapid rise has terrorized and disgusted intelligent Greeks everywhere.</li></ul>
<p><strong>8pm GMT</strong> I stop the DDOS attack entirely. Due to some misconfiguration in their anti-DDOS shit-kit, the site doesn't go back up. The main page, that was meant to redirect like '?COLLCC=&lt;10-digit number&gt;', actually does: '?COLLC=&lt;10-digits&gt;&amp;COLLC=&lt;another 10-digits&gt;', and the site will not load. After a few hours, it stops responding altogether "The connection with the server was reset". I verify this with services like downforeveryone.com. &lt;sarcasm&gt;My multiple foreign intelligence agency friends, partners and clients are laughing our asses off.&lt;/sarcasm&gt; This was too easy.</p>

<h3>26 December 2013</h3>

<p><strong>7pm GMT</strong> &middot; I start a fairly sizable Layer 7 DDOS against what I believed to be the xryshaygh.com backend - 192.184.9.83 and 192.184.9.84.</p>

<p><strong>9pm GMT</strong> &middot; I realize I am mistaken. xryshaygh.com is down, however www.xryshaygh.com responds normally. I change the target to http://xryshaygh.com/ and http://www.xryshaygh.com/</p>

<p><strong>a few minutes later</strong> Both xryshaygh.com and www.xryshaygh.com are mostly down. Very few requests are processed, if any..</p>
